The Jenkins file is just for running everything in the right order in case anyone wants to run this via Jenkins
The task2-bash.sh script is only for running the api server, it should run AFTER the python script
All scripts can be runed manually on every supported environment. the right order is:
1. Task1.sh
2. Task2.py
3.task2-bash.sh
